# Day-Planner

* Created a simple day planner application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 
* The app displays the current time and date.
* Each time slot represent one hour and contain the following:-
     
     The time

     A field to hold user input

     A save button

* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.

* Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when      the application is refreshed.
